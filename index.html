					<h2>Frozen</h2>
					<p>The instant classic that teaches us an act of true love doesn't have to be a kiss from a man. The white-haired and usually blue-dressed Elsa ends up causing a ruckus, finding herself, and then saving the life of her redish-haired usually pink-dressed sister Anna. Thanks to Elsa the phrase "Let it go" will never be the same. </p>
